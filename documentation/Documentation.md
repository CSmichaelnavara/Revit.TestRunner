## Intension
The goal of this add-in is to write test for your add-in. Because it is not possible to start revit as a 'service' or start from a test, it is necessary to start Revit first, then start your tests. In this case, the Revit context is available in the tests.

## Test execution
Tests must be executed over the desktop or the console aplication. They must run in context of Revit. If Revit including Revit.TestRunner is running, they run directly. If Revit is not running, Revit will be started first.

### Desktop application
Browse thru a selected test assembly to select test for running or create a request file. Even displaing the tests in the assembly, Revit must be running or will be started.

### Console application
The console runner consume a reqeust file and run the tests specified.

## Writing Tests
First add the NuGet package of [NUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit/) to the test project.

A test must be marked with the ```Test``` Attribute of the NUnit 3 library. All marked methods will be recognized when the test assembly is loaded. A ```Test``` is executable. 
A method marked with the ```SetUp``` Attribute will be executed before each test.
A method marked with the ```TearDown``` Attribute will be executed after each test.

```C#
[SetUp]
public void MySetUp(){
    // Do some stuff before the test runs.
}

[TearDown]
public void MyTearDown(){
    // Do some stuff after the test is finished
}

[Test]
public void MyTest(){
    // Do some test stuff
}
```


To get Revit API objects like ```Application``` or ```UIApplication```, extend the test method signature with one or both of the called Classes (order is not relevant). The injected objects can be used to do some stuff, for example open a file.

```C#
[Test]
public void MyTest( UIApplication uiApplication, Application application ){
    // Do some test stuff. ex.:
    uiApplication.Application.OpenDocumentFile( "C:\myTestFile.rvt" );
}
```

A sample test assembly is included in the visual studio solution.


## VisualStudio Solution
### Add-In Project
All the code of the add-in lives in the Revit.TestRunner assembly. The ```Main``` Class implements the ```IExternalApplication``` Interface. Log4Net is used as logging framework. 

### Sample Test Project
Containing some sample Tests, showing how they could be implemented.

### Build the Solution
The solution contains a 'Debug' and 'Release' build configuration for all the supported Revit versions (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021). A post-build event calls a power shell script, which will create an add-in file in the %ProgramData%\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\20xx pointing to the fresh compiled Revit.TestRunner.dll. See section Power Shell.


## Precompiled binaries
The compiled add-in is also available in the [install](../install) section. Download the whole directory and place it somewhere. Run the corresponding .cmd to install the add-in. The .addin file will be copied to the %ProgramData%\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\20xx folder, and points to the current folder and its libraries. See section Power Shell.


## Power Shell
To automatically create an addin file, power shell must be enabled on your machine. To enable run: ```c:\windows\syswow64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -command set-executionpolicy unrestricted```
